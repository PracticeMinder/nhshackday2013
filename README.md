==============

This Project is the result of an [NHS Hack Day](http://nhshackday.com/) held in 
Cambridge, UK on the second and third of November 2013.

A large amount of data about General practices in the UK is available publicly, both 
from the [Public Health Observatory](http://www.apho.org.uk/) and the 
[Health and Social Care Information Centre](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/) but efforts to 
make this data more accesible are less common than they could be.

This project is aimed at making this data available in a way that is useful to 
educators, researchers and policy makers. In particular, we were interested in merging
publicly available information about drug prescriptions with individual practice data.
